        <h1>CAMPING</h1>
        <p>From chilled out late night campfire jams to beat busting dance shows, the party at Summer Camp goes long past the end of scheduled performances. “Scampers” can apply to become camp counselors which means free tickets, free camping, and free beer in exchange for being an official party ambassador to the other attendees. Our resident festival expert calls Summer Camp — “The best festival of the Memorial Day Weekend.”</p>
